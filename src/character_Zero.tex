\chapter{Zero}\label{char:Zero}
Zero is the deuteragonist of the X series. A close friend of X, Zero acts as a counterpart for him, opposing X's kindness and uncertainty with a cold and emotionless attitude, often taking action without hesitating. However, behind his attitude Zero hides a kind but wounded soul~\cite{wiki:Zero} which cares for his friends.

\section{Creation}
Just as X was the last and best creation of Dr.~Light, Zero is the last creation of Dr.~Wily, fulfilling the doctor's dream of creating the strongest robot ever. 
Just like for X, precise information about Zero's creation or specifications are not given. The first instance of Wily talking about Zero's project can be found in Bass' ending in \textit{Mega Man: The Power Battle}, where Wily discusses with Bass about his new project, a robot capable of easily disposing of Bass himself as well as the original Mega Man\footnote{\textit{The robot I'm making right now will blow the both of you away}- Dr.~Wily, Bass ending, Mega Man: The Power Battle}. Then, in the following entry in the series, \textit{ Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters}, this discussion is resumed again, with Wily talking about how he managed to learn from his mistakes, which led him to developing a new type of robot, by combining together the accidental discovery of the bassium energy as a power source or the study of both Proto Man~\cite{art:mmnetwork:24_mavs} and Mega Man:
\begin{quote}
	"I studied Megaman hoping to create a similar robot. Then I developed a powerful energy called "Bassnium" purely by accident. Thus, I created you Bass. Currently Bassnium is the most powerful energy on Earth. But, that's not for long. Hee hee, I've learned from my accident... And I've created a new type of robot which is much more powerful than you or Megaman! It'll be some time before I complete this project though. You better get ready!" - Dr. Wily, Bass ending, Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters
\end{quote}
On such occasion, Wily also shows the blueprint of his project, a shadowy silhouette of Zero with his appearance from X2 onward.

\section{The X saga and the Maverick Wars}
As Sigma go Maverick, Zero is appointed as leader of the Maverick Hunters, being the highest in rank remained within the group. He then proceeds to lead the organization against Sigma, entrusting X to deal with Sigma's subordinates while he tries to locate the enemy fortress. The two manage to complete their task simultaneously, and reunite to attack Sigma together, Zero acting as decoy due him being more powerful than X, to let him sneak inside unnoticed. Once in they briefly reunite but are interrupted by Vile which Zero  challenges to a duel, only to be caught in a trap Vile had previously prepared. Vile then proceeds to use him as a hostage and manages to capture X too, but Zero breaks free and, in order to save his friend, explodes to take down Vile too, but only manages to destroy his Ride armor. His action, however, gives X the strength necessary to break free and take Vile down definitively. With his last words Zero encourages X to proceed and face Sigma, firmly believing he has the power to beat him.

Although destroyed, Zero's control circuit remains miraculously intact and is stored at the Maverick Hunters Headquarter. Zero's body (or what remains of it) is instead recovered by the X-Hunters, which tasks Serges to repair it. Serges not only repairs Zero's body, but also upgrades it into its final version, adding the missing shoulder pads and giving him his iconic Z-Saber. For the whole duration of the X-Hunters operation Zero remains incomplete, as the two key components stay in the hands of the two opposing factions. It is only near the end that Zero is resurrected, depending on the action X takes while fighting the X-Hunters. Zero can either be saved by X, who had previously won Zero's body parts from the X-Hunters, and be repaired by Dr.~Cain, or can be resurrected by Serges, after the X-Hunters steal the control circuit from the Maverick Hunters HQ. In the former case he reunites with X shortly before the final fight, just in time to destroy his clone, while in the latter case he will be put under Sigma's control and will fight X, which has to defeat him and make him come to his senses. Whichever the case is, Zero aids X during the final confrontation with Sigma, by destroying the main computer Sigma is using to spread his virus around the world.
