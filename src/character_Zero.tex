\section{The X saga and the Maverick Wars}
As Sigma go Maverick, Zero is appointed as leader of the Maverick Haunters, being the highest in rank remained within the group. He than proceeds to lead the organization against Sigma, entrusting X to deal with Sigma's subordinates while he tries to locate the enemy fortress. The two manage to complete their task simultaneously, and reunite to attack Sigma together, Zero acting as decoy due him being more powerful than X, to let him sneak inside unnoticed. Once in they briefly reunite but are interrupted by Vile which Zero  challenges to a duel, only to be caught in a trap Vile had previously prepared. Vile than proceed to use him as an hostage and manages to capture X too, but Zero breaks free and, in order to save his friend, explodes to take down Vile too, but only manages to destroy his Ride armor. His action, however, give X the strength necessary to break free and take Vile down definitively. With his last words Zero encourage X to proceed and face Sigma, firmly believing he has the power to beat him.

Although destroyed, Zero's control circuit remains miraculously intact and is stored at the Maverick Hunters Headquarter. Zero's body (or what remains of it) is instead recovered by the X-Hunters, which tasks Serges to repair it. Serges not only repairs Zero's body, but also upgrade it into its final version, adding the missing shoulder pads and giving Zero his iconic Z-Saber. For the whole duration of the X-Hunters operation Zero remains incomplete, as the two key components stays in the hand of the two opposing factions. It is only near the end that Zero is resurrected, depending on the action X takes while fighting the X-Hunters. Zero can either be saved by X, who had previously won Zero's body parts from the X-Hunters, and be repaired by Dr.~Cain, or can be resurrected by Serges, after the X-Hunters steal the control circuit from the Maverick Hunters HQ. In the former case he reunite with X shorty before the final fight, just in time to destroy his clone, while in the latter case he will be put under Sigma's control and will fight X, which has to defeat him and make him come to his sense. Whichever the case is, Zero aid X during the final confrontation with Sigma, by destroying the main computer Sigma is using to spread his virus in the world.
