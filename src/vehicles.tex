A list of all vehicles present in the X series. Artworks from~\cite{book:MMX_Complete_art}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \hypertarget{vehicle:Death_Rogumer}{\textbf{Death Rogumer:}}
	An Aerial battleship made for the Maverick Hunter's air cavalry. Originally made in order to hold down reploid rebellions, Sigma converted it as a fortress 
	for his army, entrusting the command to the former leader of 7th Airborne unit, Storm Eagle~\cite{wayback:X_resources}.

	\item \hypertarget{vehicle:Ride_Armor}{\textbf{Ride Armor:}}
	Ride Armors are mechas similar to tanks with attached hands and feet. Originally these machines were made intended to be used in engineering~\cite{wayback:X_resources}, but were later used also for fighting, as they greatly increase the power of their user due being able to dash, walk over spikes, deliver powerful attacks and receive damage in place of 
	their pilot. Starting from this base version many others will be created, focused more on combat power. Vile himself uses two modified Ride Armors in his confrontation with X, although both of them were destroyed by Zero.

	\item \hypertarget{vehicle:Ride_Armor_Rabbit}{\textbf{Ride Armor EG-2 custom ``\textit{Rabbit}'':}}
	Upgraded version of the original ride armor drove by Vile and X. It is  equipped with drill hands for mine excavation, and jets attached to its back for improved, although limited, flight ability~\cite{wayback:X2_resources}.

	\item \hypertarget{vehicle:Ride_Armor_Chimera}{\textbf{Ride Armor type DRA-00 ``\textit{Chimera}'':}} Default form of the general purpose Ride Armor DRA-00. It provides average mobility, but it can be customized using different modules. In the game's manual it was stated that Dr.~Light had created the custom modules~\cite{X3:Manual}, but it was later changed to be a creation of the Maverick Hunters~\cite{book:Compendium}.

When charged up, it can use the Spinning Claw attack, firing its claws with a chain attached to it~\cite{wayback:X3_resources,book:MH_field_guide}.
