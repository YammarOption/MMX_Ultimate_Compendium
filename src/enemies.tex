	\enemSpecs{64 (0.15 seconds of Iframe, Boomerang Cutter, Sting Chameleon and Rolling Shields hit for 8 damage) }{4 (contact), 2(snakes)}{Anglerge are angler-type mechaniloids that work to cleaning the seabed floor, with a motion sensor attached to its "lantern" part. Anglerge's attack are only four: send four snake-like robots toward X (two upward and two downward), which travel horizontally and descend when above (or below) X; a vacuum attack to push or pull X toward a spike pit; a (rare) energy beam from the angler (which can be disabled if the lamp is broken via an attack).}

	\enemSpecs{32 (No Iframes)}{4 (contact), 2(missiles), 1 (machine gun)}{A large bee-type helicopter which was created in order to carry \hyperlink{enem:Ball_De_Voux}{Ball de Voux}. It is equipped with a vulcan machine-gun and homing missiles. This mechaniloid has been created for guerrilla operations in forests and cities. While they don't appear formidable enemies, they can be rather dangerous, especially if X defeats them while standing below, as they will fall and crush him instantly.}

	\enemSpecs{64 (resist most weapons but no Iframes, meaning a Storm Tornado is a guaranteed kill)}{3 (bombs)}{Whale mechaniloid who patrols the sea with its powerful weapon. Some kind of mistake caused it to lose its sea navigation, its attack circuits began running wild, and communications were lost. Its body is totally invincible, save for its core on top.}

Fire Wave deals 3 damage each 2 frames)}{Insta-kill (roller), 2 (contact)}{Mechanioid used to open up paths in mines, using a rotary roller to destroy rocks that obstruct his path. Its armoring can take a lot of damage, while the roller is completely invincible and can instantly kill X. The only way to deal with it is to attack from behind, although several shots are needed to take it down. Using the Fire Wave is the best option, as its continuous damage can dispose of it quickly.}

Boomerang Cutter deals 3 damage instead of 2)}{2 (contact), 2 (arm)}{In times of peace, it was a professional robot sumo wrestler and a popular Yokozuna (sumo grand champion) in the "Robot Grand Sumo Tournament". Moved in the forest, it now guards X's  Chest Parts. Its certain kill technique, the "Kagizume Beam Hand," strikes and tosses its opponents but only if it is in his claw's reach range. Otherwise he'll just jump at it to close the gap.}

	\enemSpecs{48 (0.116 seconds of Iframes, Storm Tornado hits for 9-10 damage)}{5(contact), 4(thunders)}{Thunder Slimer was born from a single question: ``How large can a single cell become?'' This monster was born from said experiment. Its body is over three times as large as X, but may require approximately 10 years before it reaches full growth. It has settled in the power plant, where he absorbs electricity and uses it to perform electric attacks against X.}

	\enemSpecs{72 (no Iframes, Boomerang Cutter hits for 3 damage instead of 2 and Storm Tornado kill it in a single shot)}{4 (contact)}{Serpent-type mechaniloid made to explore the ocean floor. Thanks to its flexible body it can zig-zag into difficult underwater areas, and burrow underground. His body is totally invincible and can work as a platform, while only the head and tail are vulnerable and can damage X.}
