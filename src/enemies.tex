		Anglerge are angler-type mechaniloids that work to cleaning the seabed floor, with a  a motion sensor attached to its "lantern" part. Anglerge's attack are only four: send four snake-like robots toward X (two upward and two downward), which travel horizontally and descend when above (or below) X; a vacuum attack to push or pull X toward a spike pit; a (rare) energy beam from the angler (which can be disabled if the lamp is broken via an attack).

		\item \hypertarget{miniboss:Mole_Borer}{\textbf{Mole Borer}}:
		Mechanioid used to open up paths in mines, using a 
		rotary roller to destroy rocks that obstacle his path. Its armoring can take a lot of damage, while the roller is completely invincible and can instantly kill X.

Otherwise he'll just jump at it to close the gap.
