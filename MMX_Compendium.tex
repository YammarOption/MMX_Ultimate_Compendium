\begin{chapter}{Mega Man X}
	Mega Man X is born as a spin-off games of the classic Mega Man franchise for the Super Famicon/SNES consoles (later also for PC)  between the 1993 and the 1995\cite{wiki:MMX}. The game take place hundred years after the main franchise timeline, in a world where humans and special robots capable of having feelings co-exists and where X, one of those robots, fights the evil Sigma which aims to eliminate humans on order to have a world only for reploids.
	\section[Main plot]{Main plot }
	In the year 21XX humans live peacefully with new kind of robots: reploids. Reploids (\ref{dict:reploids}) are a particular type of robots with the ability to take autonomous decisions as well as having feelings and sentiments\cite{Xcoll1:Manual_1}. However sometimes reploids' electric brain can undergo  malfunctioning making them act dangerously for nearby humans and reploids . When this happen the reploid is labeled as ``Maverick'' and has to be stopped, in order to be repaired or disposed, by a special organization of reploids created with the exact purpose to stop mavericks: the Maverick Haunters. Leader of the Maverick Haunters is Sigma, one of the most advanced reploid of the time. Fighting together the Maverick Haunters there is also X, the protagonist of the story, alongside his friend Zero. 
	
	The situation takes a turn when Sigma himself go maverick, declaring war against humanity and recruiting in its rank other maverick haunters, both willing to follow him or threatened by Sigma itself. In order to stop the war X decides to go and try to stop his former leader joining the fight in the highway, but is attacked by Vile, an ex-haunter released by Sigma from prison, in his ride armor. Only Zero's intervention, which force Vile to flee, allow X to escape safely. The two then decide to split: while Zero goes to locate the enemy fortress, X has to deal with the threat of Sigma's mavericks. As X defeats all the eight mavericks, acquiring in the process new power-ups and strength, he joins Zero who in the meanwhile has located the Sigma fortress flying over the sea. At the entrance however they are immediately confronted with Vile and his ride armor, which first manages to capture Zero (that challenged him in a one-versus-one fight) and subsequently X too. As Vile laughs at his victory, Zero manages to escape from his cage, latches on the ride armor and detonates himself, destroying it but leaving Vile untouched. Seeing his friend's action give X new energy, allowing him to break free from his prison and face Vile, now vulnerable, defeating him in the process. Before going on however X listens to Zero's ultimate words\cite{wiki:MMX_script}. Zero informs X that his auto-repair system cannot handle all damages taken and that X has a power even greater than his own, and that he could be capable of face Sigma (eventually Zero also gives X his own Z-buster if he didn't manage to get his own buster upgrade). After that, Zero dies and X proceeds infiltrating Sigma's fortress and his dangers, including re-facing all the previously-defeated mavericks. At the end X arrives at Sigma's place where he was waiting. At first Sigma acts with arrogance, looking surprised that X has managed to reach him with his only forces and claiming he could destroy him without effort. However he decides to leave the pleasure to his pet Velguarder, as he leaves the scene to assist at the fight. After X successfully manages to destroy Velguarder, Sigma changes his mind a little, understanding why Zero placed his trust in X and claiming X could have been an haunter as strong as he was. After that he proceeds to confront X, but gets defeat and his body destroyed, only his head remaining which merges with a giant wolf-based mechaniloid in the room, giving Sigma a new body to fight X. However X succeeds in destroying the new body as well, effectively getting rid of Sigma for good. As Sigma blames X for destroying his dream of a world only for reploids, Sigma himself and the fortress start to explode, forcing X to teleport to the outside. In the end X ponders about the destruction he helped to generate, on the sacrifices made for the victory, and questioning if choosing to fight was the right choice, meditating if another option was possible. As the flying fortress sink in the ocean, X realizes that he will have to fight more battles before having the answers he needs. 
	After the game's credits, it is then revealed that the next battle will not take long before occurring, since a message form Sigma is played, where the maverick states that his spirit is still intact and waiting for a new body to be built for face X again.
