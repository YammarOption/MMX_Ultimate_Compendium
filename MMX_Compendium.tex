\part{Games}
	\section*{Preface}
	This document aims to be a compendium of all the knowledge available of Mega Man X games, from main plot/lore to game mechanics, including trivia, fun facts and even glitches/bugs. For each game in the series information regarding story, characters (although only in a superficial way), weapons and game mechanics will be presented, as well as an analysis of each stage including its secrets and boss (with both story-related and game game-related information). Following games analysis, a more accurate and complete description of each character will be presented, combining pieces of information coming from different sources, both in-game and from other official materials.
	
	This document is meant to be accessible and understandable to everyone, from experienced players to new ones, from people who want to learn more about the serieâ€™s lore to ones who want to discover tricks and secrets of each game. Moreover it is open for editing to anybody: everyone can suggest additions if something is missing or modifications if any mistakes were made.
	
	Finally, one last remark has to be done. This document is not meant to be a guide of any kind, nor for new players or speedrunners. While some tips for both of these categories will be given, what is presented here should not be taken as a guide of any kind.
	
	\section*{How to read this document}
	While reading the document, readers will notice words or numbers with different colors. These are actually links that connect various parts of the document to each other to allow the reader to jump between various sections and chapters. More precisely:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{Blue text} are links to other sections of the document, typically with a deeper analysis of referred arguments.
		\item \textcolor{red}{Red numbers} refers to bibliographic references, shown in the text with entry number in the bibliography between squared brackets. Clicking these numbers will bring the reader to the corresponding bibliographic entry.
		\item \textcolor{cyan}{Cyan text} are urls referring to web pages, typically source of bibliographic material.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Furthermore, since in some occasion words and figures are not enough to describe a concept, together with this document a video folder is also included, which contains short video demonstration of what explained in text.

\part{Characters}
	\chapter*{Preface}
	In this part more detailed information about characters who appear in the Mega Man X series are given. Here, however, information will not only come from in-game material but also from external (but still official) sources which expand and complete what is said inside games. Another difference between this part of the document and previous ones is the fact that while in precedent chapters only facts were reported, leaving out any interpretation, here the objective is to try to put together all information available, even giving a plausible solution in case of conflicting elements. In any case whenever a solution is proposed it will be clarified, to let readers know what parts come from official sources and what instead are created solely for this document.

	As the document proceeds some time reference will be given for some of the events that occur. However in some occasions the same events can refer to different points in time depending on the game's version or the source of the information. While these discrepancies will still be appointed, since the focus here is to give a coherent timeline of events there will be now listed all time-related assumption made in this part, with a short explanation:
	\begin{itemize}
	%\item X's slumber last 100 years (it is never clarified the real duration, but 100 years is always given as minimum value)
	%\item X wakes up at least in 2114, as it is possible to see in the \x opening observing Dr.~Cain's  PC copyright years.
	%\item By the previous two statements, X had to be sealed roughly around 2014.
		\item Maverick Haunters operate for about two years before the first games' event, according to the Japanese version of Dr.~Cain's journal, contrary to the two-month stated in the English version of the same source. This due the fact that two months aren't sufficient to explain all events that occur before the first game, such as Zero's awakening, X joining the Haunters or X befriending Zero.
		\item According to the original story, X does not join the Haunters until Sigma's revolution begins. Here we deliberately choose the \mhx storytelling, as it allows us to better explain some relationship between characters.
		\item Events shown in \textit{Day of $\Sigma$}, save for Dr.~Cain's fate, actually happens. This is mainly due to the fact that what shown isn't in direct contrast with anything shown in games .		
	\end{itemize}
	}
	}

\warningbox{\small{
		\begin{itemize}	
				\item After his death, Dr.~Light consciousness keeps living via AI, which communicates with X via his capsules. This due the fact that in multiple occasions Dr.~Light is fully aware of the circumstances and even directly answer posed questions.
		\end{itemize}
